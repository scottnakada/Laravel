Laravel Projects

	Laravel is a PHP framework for developing web-projects.  This
repo contains some sample Laravel projects.

todo - a simple task list, which demonstrates developing a CRUD
	interface to (C) Add tasks, (R) display tasks, (U) edit tasks,
	and (D) delete tasks

products - create a products interface, and can add products/price,
    list products, edit products, and delete products

prodAuth - products interface, with login/user authorization, and
	routing between views.

routing - shows different ways to setup routes, and use them in
    a menu system.

laracom - This is a copy of a cool Laravel e-commerce template.
    It is based on Laravel 5.4; but the composer file loads
    the correct dependencies, and the program works.
